# LAP 2 Code-Challenge

# AnonyMouse Tail Tales

## Brief

Create a web app to allow for (optionally) anonymous thought posting.

Base the design aesthetic on a platform such as [Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/).

### Requirements
- The app should have a browser client allowing users to write a post with a title, a pseudonym and a body
- No login should be required to create a post or visit a post
- When a user hits 'publish', the post should be stored in a database and the client redirected to a show path
- The user should be able to access their post using that show path even after a server restart
- Edit and delete functionality is not required
